# Guide

This document describes how to get your new project up and running.

## First steps

1. Install and authorize [Probot settings](https://github.com/probot/settings).
2. Open `pyproject.toml` and edit the `[project]` and `[tool.tyranno]` sections.
   If you created with `tyranno new`, these were already filled in.
3. Generate a **classic**
   [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
4. Save it as `PAT`.

We do not follow [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Instead, we use [GitHub release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
See the [maintainer guide](https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/ref/maintainer-guide/) for more information.
