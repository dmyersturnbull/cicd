# Updates the code coverage reports and sends them to Coveralls and/or Codecov.
# Coveralls can be disabled by setting "if: false"
# Codecov can be disabled the same way
# Codecov needs secret CODECOV_TOKEN which Codecov will provide
# It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and release branches.
# Generates and sends reports for multiple OSes and Python versions.
