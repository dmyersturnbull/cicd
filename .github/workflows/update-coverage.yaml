# Updates the code coverage reports and sends them to Coveralls and/or Codecov.
# Coveralls needs secret FAKE_COVERALLS_TOKEN which can be anything non-empty
# Codecov needs secret CODECOV_TOKEN which Codecov will provide
# It is triggered by pushes to the main branch and release branches.
# Generates and sends reports for multiple OSes and Python versions.
